QM/MM methods for biomolecular systems
HM Senn, W Thiel - Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 2009 - Wiley Online Library
Two are better than one: Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods are 
the state‐of‐the‐art computational technique for treating reactive and other “electronic” 
processes in biomolecular systems. This Review presents the general methodological …

QM/MM methods for biological systems
HM Senn, W Thiel - Atomistic approaches in modern biology, 2006 - Springer
Thirty years after the seminal contribution by Warshel and Levitt, we review the state of the 
art of combined quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) methods, with a focus 
on biomolecular systems. We provide a detailed overview of the methodology of QM/MM  …

A priori evaluation of aqueous polarization effects through Monte Carlo QM-MM simulations
J Gao, X Xia - Science, 1992 - science.sciencemag.org
A Monte Carlo quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM-MM) simulation method 
was used to determine the contributions of the solvent polarization effect to the total 
interaction energies between solute and solvent for amino acid side chains and nucleotide …

Geometry optimization with QM/MM, ONIOM, and other combined methods. I. Microiterations and constraints
T Vreven, K Morokuma, Ö Farkas… - Journal of …, 2003 - Wiley Online Library
Hybrid energy methods such as QM/MM and ONIOM, that combine different levels of theory 
into one calculation, have been very successful in describing large systems. Geometry 
optimization methods can take advantage of the partitioning of these calculations into a …

P450 enzymes: Their structure, reactivity, and selectivity modeled by QM/MM calculations
S Shaik, S Cohen, Y Wang, H Chen, D Kumar… - Chemical …, 2009 - ACS Publications
The introduction of oxygen into biochemical processes has brought about an evolutionary 
leap in the history of life, whereby many organisms have evolved to use oxygen as part of 
the life sustaining process and at the same time invented means to lower its toxic effects. 1 …

QUASI: A general purpose implementation of the QM/MM approach and its application to problems in catalysis
P Sherwood, AH de Vries, MF Guest… - Journal of Molecular …, 2003 - Elsevier
We describe the work of the European project QUASI (Quantum Simulation in Industry, 
project EP25047) which has sought to develop a flexible QM/MM scheme and to apply it to a 
range of industrial problems. A number of QM/MM approaches were implemented within the …

A generalized hybrid orbital (GHO) method for the treatment of boundary atoms in combined QM/MM calculations
J Gao, P Amara, C Alhambra… - The Journal of Physical …, 1998 - ACS Publications
A generalized hybrid orbital (GHO) method has been developed at the semiempirical level 
in combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations. In this 
method, a set of hybrid orbitals is placed on the boundary atom between the QM and MM …

Frontier bonds in QM/MM methods: A comparison of different approaches
N Reuter, A Dejaegere, B Maigret… - The Journal of Physical …, 2000 - ACS Publications
A major complication in hybrid QM/MM methods is the treatment of the frontier between the 
quantum part, describing the reactive region, and the classical part, describing the 
environment. Two approaches to this problem, the “link atom” method and the “local self …
